So here's what my plan is:
I'm going to add the Profile to users DIRECTLY IN ServerMain instead of outside it,
since for some reason the users ArrayList isn't the same for each Client when added outside.
To do this, I'm trying to automatically send over the username of the Client to the
BufferedReader of the Server upon connecting, but I'm having trouble with this.
Hopefully you can find a way to do this.

In ServerMain, there is a commented code block in setUpNetworking().
Maybe you could use this.
